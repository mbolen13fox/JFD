Course Description
==================
JavaScript for Designers will be a course geared towards Designers who are new to web design, or have some basic knowledge of the web, but would like to learn more about the lucrative subject of JavaScript. We will have a group project every week related to the course material covered, along with a smaller, less involved personal project. We will cover a wide range of subjects including basic JavaScript Syntax, locating and interpreting documentation, jQuery and jQueryUI, DOM manipulation, working with APIs, and basic version control with Git. All software needed for this workshop will be open source. No books required.
