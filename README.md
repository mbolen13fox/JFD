JavaScript for Designers Class Information and class projects

**Resources**
This directory is full of resources to help on your journey to learning javascript. I will add more to this soon.

**Example Projects**
This directory is where I will put my solutions to the week's projects, along with other challenges.
_Remember_ - There is always more than one solution to most of these challenges. Just because my example looks different than what you wrote, does not mean it is any less right.
_If I fits, I sits._

**Weeks**
This is where I put the lesson plan for each week. It's kind of a general overview of what I'd like to guys to learn during each class. If you have any questions, or see anything I didn't cover that you'd like to learn, feel free ask.
