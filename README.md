# JavaScript for Designers
JFD Class Information and class projects

**Resources**
This directory is full of resources to help on your journey to learning javascript. I will add more to this soon.

**Example Projects**
This directory is where I will put my solutions to the week's projects, along with other challenges.
_Remember_ - There is always more than one solution to most of these challenges. Just because my example looks different than what you wrote, does not mean it is any less right.
_If I fits, I sits._

**Weeks**
This is where I put the lesson plan for each week. It's kind of a general overview of what I'd like to guys to learn during each class. If you have any questions, or see anything I didn't cover that you'd like to learn, feel free ask.

Course Description
==================
JavaScript for Designers will be a course geared towards Designers who are new to web design, or have some basic knowledge of the web, but would like to learn more about the lucrative language. We will have a group project every week related to the course material covered, along with a smaller, less involved personal project. We will cover a wide range of subjects including basic JavaScript Syntax, locating and interpreting documentation, jQuery and jQueryUI, DOM manipulation, working with APIs, and basic version control with Git. All software needed for this workshop will be open source. No books required.
