# Tools

This is an extremely powerful text editor, with optional plugins ranging from automatic Linters (http://www.jslint.com/) to different syntax highlighting and more.

_Atom Editor_

https://atom.io/


Atom Editor is a text editor built by github with node.js. It is very similar to Sublime Text. You can get optional plugins and tools to use while developing.
Also, if you decide you like javascript and get proficient enough to learn how Nodejs works, you can start writing you own plugins!

_jsFiddle_

http://jsfiddle.net/


It's a little broken right now in my browser (Firefox), but it is a great tool to test how well your JavaScript, HTML, and CSS play together.

_JSLint_

http://www.jslint.com/


Just copy and paste your code, give it some default parameters you'd like your code to adhere to, and jslint will give you a line by line synopsis of your code.
It is also available as a command line tool and plugin for Sublime Text and Atom, if you would rather run the tests locally.

_Git_

http://git-scm.com/


>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.


Git is used by many web development teams to keep a history of their code. If you plan to work with development teams at all, I would suggest learning at least the basics. Not only will it make the dev team love you, having this skill as a designer will make you much more lucrative to potential employers.
