## Web Sites

_Mozilla Developer Network_ **(MDN)**

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript


MDN is an excellent reference for JavaScript methods, techniques, syntax, etc. It notes browser compatibilities and Levels of difficulty. An excellent replacement for W3C's reference.

_Stack Overflow_

http://stackoverflow.com/


Stack Overflow is an awesome community of experienced developers willing to answer your questions. I personally use this website everyday.
If you decide to post a question, be sure and google it first. If you don't, and it's a duplicate question, it will be removed, you will be downvoted, and your reputation will forever be tarnished.

_Khan Academy_

https://www.khanacademy.org/


Sal Khan has to be the smartest man on the planet. This website can teach you everything from basic math and algebra, all the way to Calculus, Linear Algebra, and on. It also has a pretty good computer science section with video guided tutorials, which we covered the first week of class. Awesome, awesome website.
